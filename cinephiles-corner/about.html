      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./images/yo.jpg" alt="My profile picture" loading="lazy">
      <p>Hello! I'm [Your Name] and I've been passionate about cinema since I was a child. I remember Sunday afternoons
        watching movies with my family and how they transported me to incredible worlds.</p>
      <p>Over time, my love for cinema grew and I started exploring different genres and directors. I love analyzing
        movies, discovering hidden messages, and appreciating the magic of the seventh art.</p>

      <h3>My cinematic journey</h3>
      <p>Over the years, I've seen hundreds of movies and developed an eclectic taste. I like both classics and modern
        productions, and I enjoy movies from all over the world.</p>
      <p>In addition to watching movies, I also like to write about them. I've collaborated with some blogs and
        magazines, and now I want to share my reviews and reflections in this personal space.</p>
